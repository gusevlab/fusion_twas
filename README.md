# Functional Summary-based Imputation

FUSION is a suite of tools for performing transcriptome-wide and regulome-wide association studies (TWAS and RWAS). FUSION builds predictive models of the genetic component of a functional/molecular phenotype and predicts and tests that component for association with disease using GWAS summary statistics.

Please see [http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/](http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/) for documentation.
